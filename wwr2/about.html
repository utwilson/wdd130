            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Founded over a decade ago by passionate river enthusiasts, RapidsEdge Rafting began as a small,
                community‑focused adventure group. 
                Over the years, we have grown into a trusted rafting outfitter known for safety, professionalism, and
                unforgettable river journeys. 
                From our first paddle strokes to today, our commitment has always remained the same — delivering
                high‑quality outdoor adventures for all.
